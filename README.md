# Dynamic Party Playlist with Spotify API

## Overview

This project explores how to use the Spotify API to analyze and arrange a playlist based on tempo and energy, creating a dynamic party flow. The goal is to structure songs in a bell-curve fashionâ€”starting slow, building up to a peak, and gradually slowing down as the party winds down.

## Features

- Uses Spotify API to retrieve track data such as tempo and energy levels.

- Clusters and reorders songs to create a natural party progression.

- Exports the reordered playlist directly to the user's Spotify account.

## How It Works

- Fetches track details (tempo, energy, etc.) from a selected Spotify playlist.

- Analyzes and clusters songs based on their beat progression.

- Reorders the playlist to create a smooth party flow.

- Updates the playlist in the user's Spotify account.
